# Database Setup Guide

This guide explains how to generate a van der Graph (vdG) database for small molecule functional
groups. If you prefer to use a pre-generated vdG database, you may skip the instructions below and download our database [here](insert-url-here).

## Setting Up a Parent Database
To generate your own vdG database, you must first set up a parent database from which to extract 
vdGs. You have two options:

### Option 1: Setting Up a Custom Parent Database for vdG Extraction
If you have your own custom PDB database that you want to use as the parent database, follow these instructions to set it up for vdG extraction.
Explain that you need it in the same database structure as the mirrored RCSB PDB.

### Option 2: Setting Up the RCSB PDB as a Parent Database for vdG Extraction
If you want to use the RCSB PDB as your parent database, follow these instructions to extract vdGs from the RCSB PDB.
