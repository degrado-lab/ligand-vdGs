First, I saved database_dict checkpoints in pkl format, but my scripts would keep
on dying, and I later discovered that it was because of memory issues. 
77k-ish pdbs were able to be processed with the pkl checkpoints.
To address the memory consumption issue, I changed the output filetype to json, 
and re-did the database_dict format to exclude use of tuples in dict keys. This method 
was used on the remaining 22k-ish pdbs. 

Then, with the database_dict that was output, I wrote out the binding sites of each PDB
to consolidated_BioLiP2_trimmed.
