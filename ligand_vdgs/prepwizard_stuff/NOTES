First, I saved database_dict checkpoints in pkl format, but my scripts would keep
on dying because of memory issues. 77k-ish pdbs were able to be processed.
I changed the output filetype to json, and re-did the database_dict format to exclude 
use of tuples in dict keys. This method was used on the remaining 22k-ish pdbs. 

Then, with the database_dict that was output, I wrote out the binding sites of each PDB
to consolidated_BioLiP2_trimmed.


============
Notes for Alan: I need to provide a script to divide pdb database dir into subdirs
to reduce filesystem burden and be compatible with the pdb mirror format.


==========
in the future: 
remove entries where it's just an iron sulfur cluster
